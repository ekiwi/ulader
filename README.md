uLader
=================

This project aims at creating a backup battery powered bike
lighting system.
It borrows from the great work done by the developers of the
Forumslader and acknowledges this by incorporation
Lader (german for charger) into its name.
The u stands for the micro controller used in this design,
the use of which is going to add a lot more flexibility.
